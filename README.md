# Introduction

AMR (autonomous mobile robotics) platform equipped with a camera system, ultrasonic and photoelectric sensors, works with a high rate of precision and repeatability of its movements, as it uses stepper motors in its movement and navigation, the SoBot also can be termed as a research and development interface, as it facilitates the practical experimentation of algorithms from the simplest to the most complex level.

This product was developed 100% by Solis Tecnologia, and has a lot of technology employing cutting-edge concepts, such as:

The motors can be controlled simultaneously or individually.
The user can select different accessories to implement to the robot.
Several programming languages can be used to connect via API.
